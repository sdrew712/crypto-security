Research major cybersecurity breaches over the past 20 years and pick one to write a short essay on.
Ashley Madison


Give an overview of what the breach was and the motivations behind it.
The website was a dating app for people to cheat on their partners. This was the motivation behind the hack: attacking people for affairs.
The hackers threatened that they would release all of the user data including names and addresses if the site was not shut down.
Their requests were not met and they leaked the data, leading to public shaming of those caught using the site.


Explain where the “tech flaws” were, and how hackers were able to breach their system.
Ashley Madison started using bcrypt to store passwords in 2012. However, this was not always the case, and previous passwords had not 
been updated to be more secure, still using MD5 which is easier to decrypt and possible to brute-force.

The user data was stolen by the group "The Impact Team" and posted on the dark web. Later, many passwords were cracked by the group
"Cynosure Prime".


What has the company done to protect against that vulnerability.
The site's network was fully redesigned and the code was all reviewed. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner worked with Ashley Madison
to protect their site in Canada, and in the US the FTC had the site meet the Cybersecurity Framework standards. The site also has had
white hat hackers test their site to ensure security.
